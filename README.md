# SearchPlaceAutocompelete-Google-API
Autocomplete for places and addresses

# Introduction

Autocomplete is a feature of the Places library in the Google Maps JavaScript API. You can use autocomplete to give your applications the type-ahead-search behavior of the Google Maps search field. When a user starts typing an address, autocomplete will fill in the rest.

  Note: As defined by the Google Places API, a 'place' can be an establishment, a geographic location, or a prominent point of interest.
  
  
  The Places service is a self-contained library, separate from the main Maps JavaScript API code. To use the functionality contained within this library, you must first load it using the libraries parameter in the Maps API bootstrap URL:
  
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places"></script>
